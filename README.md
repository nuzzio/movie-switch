# Movie Switch - Relationship Harmonizer

## Overview

This small web application simply records the state of the toggle into the browser `localStorage`. Using this method means that the state of movie picking will live in the browser of the device used to set it. The main goal is to spend the least mental energy on deciding or remembering who picks the movie. The device your select should belong to the party that feels most affected by the current lack of structure. This arrangement will result in both a show of trust and empowerment to the owner of the device.

## Usage

1. Deploy to your server.
2. Select a single mobile device to be the source of truth.
3. Pull up site on the mobile device.
4. Save the site to the home screen.
5. Every time you decide to watch a film, open the site, and record who picks the film.
6. Enjoy never thinking about whose pick it is.
