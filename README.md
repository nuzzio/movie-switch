# Movie Switch - Relationship Harmonizer

## Overview

This small web application simply records the state of the toggle into the browser `localStorage`. Using this method means that the state of movie picking will live in the browser of the device used to set it. The main goal is to spend the least mental energy on deciding or remembering who picks the movie. The device your select should belong to the party that feels most affected by the current lack of structure. This arrangement will result in both a show of trust and empowerment to the owner of the device.
